## About Me

I am currently a masterâ€™s student major in Computational Sciences at [Laurentian University](https://laurentian.ca/). I received my M.Eng. degree from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) in 2023, advised by Prof. [Zhaofeng He](https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/hezhaofeng/en/index.htm), Prof. [Peipei Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=A0khpKYAAAAJ&hl=en), and Prof. [Liuyu Xiang](https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/xiangliuyu/en/index.htm),
and my B.S. degree from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/) in 2020. 

My research lies at the intersection of **computer vision** and **machine learning** -- with a special focus on iris image restoration aiming to improve iris recognition. My research interests include **artificial general intelligence**, **data compression**, and **efficient machine learning**.
